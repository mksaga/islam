# What to Say in Prayer

bold = Arabic (what you should actually say), italic = translation/what you should be thinking as you say it

# *the prayer*

## before starting

- facing the Ka'bah (term for this direction is **qibla**, basically northeast. you can actually look this up for Tulsa to get exact degree measure)
- in a state of wudu
- body is covered properly (belly button to knees)



## starting

1. make intention ("I'm praying fajr/zuhr/asr/maghreb/isha")
2. raise hands up to ears
3. say "**Allahu akbar**" (*God is Greater*. idea: you're starting prayer now, for the next few minutes God will be a greater priority than anything else going on)
4. bring hands back down; right hand grasping left wrist over your chest

## standing (qiyam)

### what to say 

#### *every cycle*

first chapter of the Qur'an, al-Fatiha ("The Opening"):

**Bismillah irrahman irraheem** *In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful*

1. **Alhamdu lillahi rabb il alameen** *Praise belongs to God, Lord of all worlds*
2. **Arr rahman irraheem** *the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy*
3. **Maliki yawmiddeen** *Master of the Day of Judgement*
4. **Iyyaka na'budu wa iyyaka nasta'een** *It is You we worship; it is You we ask for help*
5. **Ih-dinas-siratal mustaqeem** *Guide us to the straight path:*
6. **Siratal-ladheena an'am-ta alayhim ghayril maghdoobi alayhim walad daalleeen** *the path of those You have blessed, those who incur no anger and who have not gone astray*

**Ameen**

#### *in 1st and 2nd cycles only*

recite anything of the Qur'an, literally anything! (Preferably at least 3 verses though). I recommend looking at the last 16 chapters to start- they are short but powerful and impactful. I'll write out some transliterations here later.

a few chapters that would be good:

## bowing (rukoo)

### transition into bowing

**Raise your hands to your ears** and say, ***Allahu akbar*** (*God is Greater*)

### while bowing
- hands on your knees
- back parallel to ground

say 3x: **Subhana rabbee al-adheem** (*Glory be to my Master, the Most Great*)

## getting up from bowing

- stand back up
- once you are standing, **raise hands up to ears** (this is called *takbeer*)
- put hands back down, lying by your sides
- say: **sami'a Allahu liman hamidah** (*Allah hears closely from whoever praises Him*)ðŸŽµ

## prostration (sujood)

- say **Allahu akbar** (*God is Greater*)
- go down into prostration

### what to say

say 3x: **Subhana rabbiyal a'la** (*How Perfect is my Master, the Most High*)
Since this is the lowest position in the prayer, we comment on how Lofty Allah is

After saying that, this is the time to talk to Allah, ask anything and just open up. Prostration is the best time to do that.

Some pointers on what it looks like:
- hands, nose, forehead, knees, and toes will be touching the ground
- toes are curled, pointing forwards
- if you are praying alone, elbows should be out to your sides; if praying in congregation, keep elbows tucked in
- elbows and arms should be off the ground (only hands touching)

## sitting between prostrations (juloos)

say **Allahu akbar** (*God is Greater*), then just get up from prostration.

some pointers on what it looks like:
- hands are resting on your legs, right above your knees. fingers pointing forwards, slightly spread out
- right foot is upright, perpendicular to ground; toes curled and pointing forwards
- left foot is parallel to the ground, you kind of sit on it

### what to say

say 2x: **rabb ighfirli** (*O God, forgive me*)

## go back into prostration (sujood)

say **Allahu akbar** again, then go down into prostration. Will look the exact same as described above.

---
Now, pray one more cycle, exactly as described above (*once you get up, just say "Allahu akbar" and **don't** raise hands*)

## changing things up!!

Once you get up from this second prostration, you have completed one cycle (arabic word: **rak'ah**) of prayer. 

Lengths of each prayer:
- *Fajr* (pre-sunrise): 2 cycles 
- *Dhuhr* (afternoon): 4 cycles
- *Asr* (late afternoon): 4 cycles
- *Maghrib* (post-sunset): 3 cycles
- *Isha* (late night): 4 cycles

What happens next depends... keep in mind, we are currently in prostration of the 2nd cycle, head on the ground.

### here are the situations:

#### If this prayer is 2 cycles:

- sit up from prostration
- **skip to "[process to exit](#process-to-exit)**


#### If this prayer is 3 cycles:

- sit up
- read [tashahud part A](#part-a)
- stand up (*once you get up, just say "Allahu akbar" and **don't** raise hands*)
- pray 3rd cycle, only al-Fatiha [click here](#standing-qiyam)
- get up from prostration
- **skip to [process to exit](#process-to-exit)**

#### If this prayer is 4 cycles:

- sit up
- read [tashahud part A](#part-a)
- stand up
- pray 3rd cycle, only al-Fatiha [click here](#standing-qiyam)
- pray 4th cycle, only al-Fatiha
- get up from prostration
- **skip to [process to exit](#process-to-exit)**

---

### process to exit
- sit up
- read tashahud A + B
- say salam to right and left
    - turn head to right
    - say **Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah** 
    - turn head to left
    - say **Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah**

---

## the tashahud (what you have to say while sitting after the second cycle/after fourth cycle to exit prayer)?

say:

### part A:

**Attahiyyatu lillahi wassalawatu wattayibatu assalamu alayka ayyuhannabiyyu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, assalamu alayna wa ala ibadillah issaliheen**

*Greetings, prayers, and all pure things ultimately belong to God. May the peace of God be with you, Prophet, as well as God's mercy and blessings. May the peace of God be with us and with all of God's righteous servants.*

**ash hadu `raise finger` alla ilaha illallah wa ash hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasuluh `lower finger`**

*I declare that no one deserves to be worshipped except God and I declare that Muhammad is His servant and messenger.*

[back up to start of cycle](#standing-qiyam)

### part B:

**Allahumma salli 'ala muhammadin wa 'ala aali muhammadin kama sallayta 'ala ibrahima wa 'ala aali ibrahim, innaka hamidum majid**

*God, bless Muhammad and his family, just as you have blessed Ibrahim and his family. You are the Praiseworthy and Glorious.*

**Allahuma barik 'ala Muhammadiw wa 'ala aali muhammadin kama barakta 'ala ibrahima wa 'ala aali ibrahima innaka hamidum majid**

*God, favor Muhammad and his family, just as you have favored Ibrahim and his family. You are the Praiseworthy and Glorious.*

to exit the prayer:

turn to the right and say **Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah** (*May the peace and mercy of God be with you*), then turn to the left and say the same thing. 


## what does a shorter cycle look like?

same exact procedure as a normal cycle above, with one exception:

after reciting al-Fatiha (the opening chapter), you don't recite any other Qur'an- you go straight into **rukoo'** (bowing) then continue as normal
